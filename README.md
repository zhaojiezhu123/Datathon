# Datathon Pet Insurance

  In the past two decades, the Australian pet insurance market has grown rapidly driven by a cultural shift towards treating pets as real family members. As costs for pets have risen due to medical care such as surgeries, diagnostics, vaccinations, and 
dental care, most pet owners have sought financial protection to deal with these issues. Therefore, pet insurance has become a desirable choice. Faced with such a competitive pet insurance market, how to make a success is a tough task. We aim to deliver
competitive premiums, maintain an optimal loss ratio, and ensure long-term sustainability in a crowded market.  This project, based on collected historical data, provides an introduction to the GLM pricing method for pet insurance and identifies
key factors that significantly impact pet insurance. Finally, it performs pricing estimation on the test set.
